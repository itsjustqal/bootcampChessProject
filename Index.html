      <p> I like to read (mostly manga/light novels) and play a lot of games
      experience before bootcamp). As your progress through your degree at City you will 
      be able to add more here (e.g., interests, skills, experience, a link to a CV). However,
      even then, it's better to keep this information concise (about a paragraph or two)
      and let your CV and the projects below to do the rest of the talking.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Chess  </h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and understanding of movement for chess pieces. I created a chess board game in which two players may able to play at the same time against each other. This may include the not widely known move as en passant and castling which I had a little help with. From the program alone the pieces background is white mostly because I cant find a transparent background for the icons.
